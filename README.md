# Nexus Go SDK

Client and server package for working with the Nexus [HTTP API](https://github.com/nexus-rpc/api).

**⚠️ EXPERIMENTAL ⚠️**

## Installation

```shell
go get -u github.com/nexus-rpc/sdk-go
```

## Usage

### Import

```go
import (
	"github.com/nexus-rpc/sdk-go/nexus"
)
```

### Client

The Nexus Client is used to start operations and get [handles](#operationhandle) to existing, asynchronous operations.

#### Create a Client

```go
client, err := nexus.NewClient(nexus.ClientOptions{
	ServiceBaseURL: "https://example.com/path/to/my/service",
})
```

#### Start an Operation

```go
// options is a StartOperationOptions struct that can also be constructed directly.
// See the StartOperationRequest definition for advanced options, such as setting a request ID, and arbitrary HTTP
// headers.
options, _ := nexus.NewStartOperationOptions("example", MyStruct{Field: "value"})
result, err := client.StartOperation(ctx, options)
if err != nil {
	var unsuccessfulOperationError *nexus.UnsuccessfulOperationError
	if errors.As(err, &unsuccessfulOperationError) { // operation failed or canceled
		fmt.Printf("Operation unsuccessful with state: %s, failure message: %s\n", unsuccessfulOperationError.State, unsuccessfulOperationError.Failure.Message)
	}
	// handle error here
}
if result.Successful != nil { // operation successful
	response := result.Successful
	// must close the returned response body and read it until EOF to free up the underlying connection
	defer response.Body.Close()
	body, _ := io.ReadAll(response.Body)
	fmt.Printf("Got response with content type: %s, body first bytes: %v\n", response.Header.Get("Content-Type"), body[:5])
} else { // operation started asynchronously
	handle := result.Pending
	fmt.Printf("Started asynchronous operation with ID: %s\n", handle.ID)
}
```

#### Start an Operation and Await its Completion

The Client provides the `ExecuteOperation` helper function as a shorthand for `StartOperation` and issuing a `GetResult`
in case the operation is asynchronous.

```go
options, _ := nexus.NewExecuteOperationOptions("operation name", MyStruct{Field: "value"})
response, err := client.ExecuteOperation(ctx, options)
if err != nil {
	// handle nexus.UnsuccessfulOperationError, nexus.ErrOperationStillRunning and, context.DeadlineExceeded
}
// must close the returned response body and read it until EOF to free up the underlying connection
defer response.Body.Close()
body, _ := io.ReadAll(response.Body)
fmt.Printf("Got response with content type: %s, body first bytes: %v\n", response.Header.Get("Content-Type"), body[:5])
```

#### Get a Handle to an Existing Operation

Getting a handle does not incur a trip to the server.

```go
handle, _ := client.NewHandle("operation name", "operation ID")
```

### OperationHandle

`OperationHandle`s are used to cancel and get the result and status of an operation.

Handles expose a couple of readonly attributes: `Operation` and `ID`.

#### Operation

`Operation` is the name of the operation this handle represents.

#### ID

`ID` is the operation ID as returned by a Nexus handler in the response to `StartOperation` or set by the client in the
`NewHandle` method.

#### Get the Result of an Operation

The `GetResult` method is used to get the result of an operation, issuing a network request to the handle's client's
configured endpoint.

By default, GetResult returns (nil, `ErrOperationStillRunning`) immediately after issuing a call if the operation has
not yet completed.

Callers may set GetOperationResultOptions.Wait to a value greater than 0 to alter this behavior, causing the client to
long poll for the result issuing one or more requests until the provided wait period exceeds, in which case (nil,
`ErrOperationStillRunning`) is returned.

The wait time is capped to the deadline of the provided context. Make sure to handle both context deadline errors and
`ErrOperationStillRunning`.

Note that the wait period is enforced by the server and may not be respected if the server is misbehaving. Set the
context deadline to the max allowed wait period to ensure this call returns in a timely fashion.

⚠️ If a response is returned, its body must be read in its entirety and closed to free up the underlying connection.

Custom HTTP headers may be provided via `GetOperationResultOptions`.

```go
response, err := handle.GetResult(ctx, nexus.GetOperationResultOptions{})
if err != nil {
	// handle nexus.UnsuccessfulOperationError, nexus.ErrOperationStillRunning and, context.DeadlineExceeded
}
defer response.Body.Close()
// response type is an *http.Response
```

#### Get Operation Information

The `GetInfo` method is used to get operation information (currently only the operation's state) issuing a network
request to the service handler.

Custom HTTP headers may be provided via `GetOperationInfoOptions`.

```go
info, _ := handle.GetInfo(ctx, nexus.GetOperationInfoOptions{})
```

#### Cancel an Operation

The `Cancel` method requests cancelation of an asynchronous operation.

Cancelation in Nexus is asynchronous and may be not be respected by the operation's implementation.

Custom HTTP headers may be provided via `CancelOperationOptions`.

```go
_ := handle.Cancel(ctx, nexus.CancelOperationOptions{})
```

#### Complete an Operation

Handlers starting asynchronous operations may need to deliver responses via a caller specified callback URL.

`NewCompletionHTTPRequest` is used to construct an HTTP request to deliver operation completions - successful or
unsuccessful - to the provided callback URL.

To deliver successful completions, pass a `OperationCompletionSuccessful` struct pointer, which may also be constructed
with the `NewOperationCompletionSuccessful` helper.

Custom HTTP headers may be provided via `OperationCompletionSuccessful.Header`.

```go
completion, _ := nexus.NewOperationCompletionSuccessful(MyStruct{Field: "value"})
request, _ := nexus.NewCompletionHTTPRequest(ctx, callbackURL, completion)
response, _ := http.DefaultClient.Do(request)
defer response.Body.Close()
_, err = io.ReadAll(response.Body)
fmt.Println("delivered completion with status code", response.StatusCode)
```

To deliver failed and canceled completions, pass a `OperationCompletionUnsuccessful` struct pointer with the failure and
state attached.

Custom HTTP headers may be provided via `OperationCompletionUnsuccessful.Header`.

```go
completion := &OperationCompletionUnsuccessful{
	State: nexus.OperationStateCanceled,
	Failure: &nexus.Failure{Message: "canceled as requested"},
}
request, _ := nexus.NewCompletionHTTPRequest(ctx, callbackURL, completion)
// ...
```

### Server

The nexus package exposes a couple of user implementable interfaces for handling API requests: `Handler` and
`CompletionHandler`.

- `Handler` exposes the entire Nexus operation API for starting, canceling, getting result and information of
  operations.
- `CompletionHandler` exposes an API to handle async delivery of operation completions.

#### Create an HTTP Handler

```go
type myHandler struct {
	nexus.UnimplementedHandler
}

// Implement handler methods here ...

httpHandler := nexus.NewHTTPHandler(nexus.HandlerOptions{
	Handler: &myHandler,
})

listener, _ := net.Listen("tcp", "localhost:0")
// Handler URLs can be prefixed by using a request multiplexer (e.g. https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#ServeMux).
_ = http.Serve(listener, httpHandler)
```

#### Start an Operation

##### Respond Synchronously

Return an `OperationResponseSync` from `StartOperation`, delivering the operation result.

Use the `NewOperationResponseSync` helper for JSON responses.

`StartOperationRequest` contains the original `http.Request` for extraction of headers, URL, and request body.

Custom response headers may be provided via `OperationResponseSync.Header`.

```go
func (h *myHandler) StartOperation(ctx context.Context, request *nexus.StartOperationRequest) (nexus.OperationResponse, error) {
	return nexus.NewOperationResponseSync(MyStruct{Field: "value"}), nil
}
```

##### Indicate that an Operation Completes Asynchronously

```go
func (h *myHandler) StartOperation(ctx context.Context, request *nexus.StartOperationRequest) (nexus.OperationResponse, error) {
	return &nexus.OperationResponseAsync{OperationID: "async"}, nil
}
```

##### Respond Synchronously with Failure

```go
func (h *myHandler) StartOperation(ctx context.Context, request *nexus.StartOperationRequest) (nexus.OperationResponse, error) {
	return nil, &nexus.UnsuccessfulOperationError{
		State: nexus.OperationStateFailed, // or OperationStateCanceled
		Failure: &nexus.Failure{Message: "Do or do not, there is not try"},
	}
}
```

#### Cancel an Operation

`CancelOperationRequest` contains the original `http.Request` for extraction of headers, URL, and other useful
information.

```go
func (h *myHandler) CancelOperation(ctx context.Context, request *nexus.CancelOperationRequest) error {
	fmt.Println("Canceling", request.Operation, "with ID:", request.OperationID)
	return nil
}
```

#### Get Operation Info

`GetOperationInfoRequest` contains the original `http.Request` for extraction of headers, URL, and other useful
information.

```go
func (h *myHandler) GetOperationInfo(ctx context.Context, request *nexus.GetOperationInfoRequest) (*nexus.OperationInfo, error) {
	fmt.Println("Getting info for", request.Operation)
	return &nexus.OperationInfo{
		ID:    request.OperationID,
		State: nexus.OperationStateRunning,
	}, nil
}
```

#### Get Operation Result

The `GetOperationResult` method is used to deliver an operation's result inline. Similarly to `StartOperation`, this
method should return an `OperationResponseSync` or fail with an `UnsuccessfulOperationError` to indicate completion or
an `ErrOperationStillRunning` error to indicate that the operation is still running.
The method may also return a `context.DeadlineExceeded` error to indicate that the operation is still running.

`GetOperationResultRequest.Wait` indicates whether the caller is willing to wait for the operation to complete. When
set, context deadline indicates how long the caller is willing to wait for, capped by `HandlerOptions.GetResultMaxTimeout`.

`GetOperationResultRequest` contains the original `http.Request` for extraction of headers, URL, and other useful
information.

The `GetOperationResult` method is used to get the result of an asynchronous operation. Return `OperationResponseSync`
to respond successfully - inline, or error with `ErrOperationStillRunning` to indicate that an asynchronous operation is
still running. Return an `UnsuccessfulOperationError` to indicate that an operation completed as failed or canceled.

When `GetOperationResultRequest.Wait` is greater than zero, this request should be treated as a long poll. Long poll
requests have a server side timeout, configurable via `HandlerOptions.GetResultTimeout`, and exposed via context
deadline. The context deadline is decoupled from the application level Wait duration.

It is the implementor's responsiblity to respect the client's wait duration and return in a timely fashion.
Consider using a derived context that enforces the wait timeout when implementing this method and return
`ErrOperationStillRunning` when that context expires as shown in the example.

```go
func (h *myHandler) GetOperationResult(ctx context.Context, request *nexus.GetOperationResultRequest) (*nexus.OperationResponseSync, error) {
	if request.Wait > 0 { // request is a long poll
		var cancel context.CancelFunc
		ctx, cancel = context.WithTimeout(ctx, request.Wait)
		defer cancel()

		result, err := h.pollOperation(ctx, request.Wait)
		if err != nil {
			// Translate deadline exceeded to "OperationStillRunning", this may or may not be semantically correct for
			// your application.
			// Some applications may want to "peek" the current status instead of performing this blind conversion if
			// the wait time is exceeded and the request's context deadline has not yet exceeded.
			if ctx.Err() != nil {
				return nil, nexus.ErrOperationStillRunning
			}
			// Optionally translate to operation failure (could also result in canceled state).
			// Optionally expose the error details to the caller.
			return nil, &nexus.UnsuccessfulOperationError{State: nexus.OperationStateFailed, Failure: nexus.Failure{Message: err.Error()}}
		}
		return nexus.NewOperationResponseSync(result)
	} else {
		result, err := h.peekOperation(ctx)
		if err != nil {
			// Optionally translate to operation failure (could also result in canceled state).
			return nil, &nexus.UnsuccessfulOperationError{State: nexus.OperationStateFailed, Failure: nexus.Failure{Message: err.Error()}}
		}
		return nexus.NewOperationResponseSync(result)
	}
}
```

#### Handle Asynchronous Completion

Implement `CompletionHandler.CompleteOperation` to get async operation completions.

```go
type myCompletionHandler struct {}

httpHandler := nexus.NewCompletionHTTPHandler(nexus.CompletionHandlerOptions{
	Handler: &myCompletionHandler{},
})

func (h *myCompletionHandler) CompleteOperation(ctx context.Context, completion *nexus.CompletionRequest) error {
	switch completion.State {
	case nexus.OperationStateCanceled, case nexus.OperationStateFailed:
		// completion.Failure will be popluated here
	case nexus.OperationStateSucceeded:
		// read completion.HTTPRequest Header and Body
	}
	return nil
}
```

### Fail a Request

Returning an error from any of the `Handler` and `CompletionHandler` methods will result in the error being logged and
the request responded to with a generic Internal Server Error status code and Failure message.

To fail a request with a custom status code and failure message, return a `nexus.HandlerError` as the error.

```go
func (h *myHandler) StartOperation(ctx context.Context, request *nexus.StartOperationRequest) (nexus.OperationResponse, error) {
	return nil, &nexus.HandlerError{
		StatusCode: http.StatusBadRequest,
		Failure: &nexus.Failure{Message: "unmet expectation"},
	}
}
```

### Logging

The handlers log internally and accept a `log/slog.Logger` to customize their log output, defaults to `slog.Default()`.

## Failure Structs

`nexus` exports a `Failure` struct that is used in both the client and handlers to represent both application level
operation failures and framework level HTTP request errors.

`Failure`s typically contain a single `Message` string but may also convey arbitrary JSONable `Details` and `Metadata`.

The `Details` field is encoded and it is up to the library user to encode to and decode from it.
